## About the Video Course
Today's applications are built using the microservice architecture. Having a lot of microservices that need to communicate with each other can be problematic as they quickly become tightly coupled. Apache Kafka allows us to create services that are loosely coupled and operate in an event-driven way. 

We can build components that process events, apply business logic as events arrive, and publish those events further into the processing chain. You will learn how to use Apache Kafka to create applications that work in the publish-subscribe model. 

We will delve into the Kafka architecture and its Producer and Consumer API. You will learn how replication and fault tolerance is achieved in Kafka.
